# Building-AI Course Project 
**Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunication Industry**

**Project Description:**

In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model to anticipate customer churn in the telecommunication industry. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. It's a critical challenge for telecommunication companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

The project will involve analyzing historical customer data, including demographic information, usage patterns, and customer service interactions, to identify factors that contribute to churn. We will preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and then train several machine learning models to predict churn.

The primary goal is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast which customers are most likely to churn in the future. By identifying these customers early on, telecommunication companies can take proactive measures, such as offering targeted promotions or improving customer service, to mitigate churn and retain valuable customers.

The project will utilize various machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to develop and evaluate the predictive models. Additionally, we will employ techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Finally, we will deploy the trained model into a production environment, where it can be integrated into existing systems to provide real-time churn predictions. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning, this project aims to empower telecommunication companies to reduce customer churn, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately improve business outcomes.
